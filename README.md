# Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series and Neural Networks

This project is a Jupyter Notebook implementation for predicting stock prices using a time-series approach. The notebook leverages libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data handling and visualization, and `TensorFlow` for creating and training the neural network model.

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to apply time-series analysis and neural networks to forecast future stock prices. The workflow includes:
- Preprocessing the stock price data.
- Visualizing trends in the data.
- Normalizing the dataset.
- Training a neural network for time-series predictions.
- Evaluating model performance on unseen data.

## Dataset
The project uses stock price data stored locally or fetched externally. Ensure your dataset has columns such as:
- `Date`: The date of the stock price observation.
- `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`: Stock price metrics.
- `Volume`: Volume of stock traded.

### Example Dataset Format:
| Date       | Open  | High  | Low   | Close | Volume    |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 2022-01-01 | 100.5 | 105.0 | 99.0  | 103.5 | 1500000   |
| 2022-01-02 | 103.5 | 107.5 | 102.0 | 106.0 | 1700000   |

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Navigate to and open `Stock_Price_Prediction_Time_Series_NN.ipynb`.
3. Follow the step-by-step cells to:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the neural network model.
   - Evaluate and visualize predictions.

## Key Steps in the Notebook
### 1. **Import Libraries**
   Essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `TensorFlow` are imported.

### 2. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Load the dataset and check for null values or inconsistencies.
   - Normalize the data to improve the model's performance.

### 3. **Create Time-Series Data**
   - Convert stock prices into a supervised learning format by defining `X` (inputs) and `y` (outputs).

### 4. **Build the Neural Network Model**
   - Use TensorFlow/Keras to create a Sequential model with layers such as:
     - LSTM or GRU for handling time-series patterns.
     - Dense layers for prediction output.

### 5. **Train the Model**
   - Use the training data to fit the model over several epochs.
   - Monitor the training loss and validation loss.

### 6. **Evaluate and Visualize**
   - Generate predictions for the test set.
   - Plot actual vs. predicted stock prices to analyze performance.

## Model Details
The neural network is designed for time-series forecasting and includes:
- **Input Layer**: Time-series data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Recurrent layers like LSTM or GRU, followed by Dense layers.
- **Output Layer**: Single value prediction for the next time step.

### Hyperparameters:
- Epochs: *Variable based on dataset size (e.g., 50-100)*.
- Batch size: *E.g., 32*.
- Optimizer: `Adam`.

---

## Results
The project evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and plots to visualize predictions vs. actual data. Ensure sufficient training data for better accuracy.

### Example Output:
- **Training Loss**: 0.05
- **Validation Loss**: 0.08
- **MAE**: 1.20

## Future Improvements
1. **Dataset Expansion**: Use larger datasets with more diverse stock data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate technical indicators like moving averages or RSI.
3. **Model Tuning**: Experiment with advanced architectures like Transformers for better performance.
